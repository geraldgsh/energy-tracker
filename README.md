# Microverse Capstone Project - Energy Tracker
React Rails Redux

### Snapshot

![]()

### Introduction.

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. Building this project is very important for you because:

* It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications that will look really nice in your portfolio; and
* You will get feedback about the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during this section of the program.

### Tools

* Node.js
* Rails
* Ruby
* React
* React-DOM
* Redux
* npm
* CSS
* ES6
* Webpack
* prop-types
* Onsen UI

### Linter Setup

Clone file [content](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/javascript) into root directory (except for readme.md)

Install ESLint on Linux environment using the following commands

Install Node Version Manager to update NodeJS + NPM.

```sh
$curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash

$export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"

$[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

Run the following command to verify installation;

```sh
$ command -v 
nvm
```

To download, compile, and install the latest release of node, do this.

```sh
nvm install node
```

Please do the following **steps in this order**:

#### Set-up Stickler (Github app) - it will show that your app is free from style errors

1. Install stickler-ci https://github.com/apps/stickler-ci
2. Enable stickler in your repo. You can do it [here](https://stickler-ci.com/).
3. In first commit of your feature branch add a copy of [.stickler.yml](./.stickler.yml) and [.eslintrc.json](./.eslintrc.json)  to the root directory.
   - **Remember** to use both files linked above
   - **Remember** that `.stickler.yml` file name starts with a dot.
4. **Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your tem - which is a group of all Microverse students.**
    - If you think that change is necessary - open a [Pull Request in this repository](../README.md#contributing) and let your code reviewer know about it.
5. When you open your first pull request you should see Stickler's report at `Checks` tab.

#### Set-up ESlint in your local env - it will help you to find style errors

Go project folder using WSL environment and initiate NPM with following command

```sh
$ npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

About to write to /package.json:

    "url": "https://github.com/geraldgsh/redux-bookstore/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/geraldgsh/redux-bookstorer#readme"
}
```

Command above will generate a "package.json" file for ESlint work off from.

Install ESlint with following command

1. Run `npm install eslint eslint-config-airbnb --save-dev` (not sure how to use npm? Read [this](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)).

2. Run `npx eslint --init`.

3. Make sure you select the following options when prompted.

    `? How would you like to use ESLint?` To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style

    `? What type of modules does your project use?` JavaScript modules (import/export)

    `? Which framework does your project use?`  React

    `? Does your project use Typescript`  No

    `? Where does your code run?`     Browser

    `? How would you like to define a style for your project?` Use a popular style guide

    `? Which style guide do you want to follow?`      Airbnb

    `? What format do you want your config file to be in?`       JSON

    `The config that you've selected requires the following dependencies: ? Would you like to install them now with npm?`       Yes

4. Copy the contents of [.eslintrc.json](./.eslintrc.json) to the newly generated `.eslintrc.json` overwritting the previous content.

5. **Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your tem - which is a group of all Microverse students.**
    - If you think that change is necessary - open a [Pull Request in this repository](../README.md#contributing) and let your code reviewer know about it.

6. Double check your `./src` folder for any extra unnecesary `.eslint` config files that might have been generated as this might cause an issue with stickler when you create your Pull Request later on.

7. Run `npx eslint .`.

8. Fix linter errors.

9. **IMPORTANT NOTE**: feel free to research [auto-correct options for ESlint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) if you get a flood of errors but keep in mind that correcting style errors manually will help you to make a habit of writing a clean code!

### Set-up Rubocop in your local env - it will help you to find style errors

1. Add `gem 'rubocop'` to `Gemfile` (not sure how to use Gemfile? Read [this](https://bundler.io/v1.15/guides/bundler_setup.html)).
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Copy [.rubocop.yml](./.rubocop.yml) to the root directory of your project
4. **Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.**
    - If you think that change is necessary - open a [Pull Request in this repository](../README.md#contributing) and let your code reviewer know about it.
5. Run `rubocop`.
6. Fix linter errors.
7. **IMPORTANT NOTE**: feel free to research [auto-correct options for Rubocop](https://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_correct/) if you get a flood of errors but keep in mind that correcting style errors manually will help you to make a habit of writing a clean code!

## Troubleshooting

1. All config files are in my repo but Stickler does not work.

   - Make sure that Stickler app has permission to access your repository. Find Stickler here https://github.com/settings/installations and check its configuration.

   ![screenshot](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/blob/master/assets/images/stickler_app_config.png)

   - Try to add a new commit to your Pull Request. Stickler should detect changes in your repo and start checking your code.

2. `while scanning for the next token found character '\t' that cannot start any token` error.
   - Please make sure that you used spaces not tabs for indentation.

3. Check if someone else has had similar problem before [here](https://questions.microverse.org/c/linters-stickler).
   Please make sure that you used spaces not tabs for indentation.

4. Stickler does not work and nothing helps üí• - run eslint in your local env and correct all errors. **Remember to let your Code Reviewer know that you had problems with Stickler and you used linter in local env.**
