### Introduction.

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. Building this project is very important for you because:

* It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications that will look really nice in your portfolio; and
* You will get feedback about the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during this section of the program.

Requirements [here](https://www.notion.so/Final-Capstone-Project-Tracking-App-22e454da738c46efaf17721826841772).

### Scenario Design

A new Kickstart company; E-Leaf have recently developed an IOT Smart Meter that records consumption of electric energy. The said IOT device; E-Monitor is designed to be installed onto a resident's electrical circuit break.

Core features are;

a. Take energy measurements of various room.
b. Communicates the information to the cloud for monitoring.
c. Keeps track of prepaid units and warns user when unit balance is running low.

E-Leaf have just released an open tender for a tracking mobile app. The tender calls for a basic proof of concept with the following hard requirements.

1. The user logs in the app, only by typing the username and password.
2. At early stages, the user is presented with a list of room energy consumption that can be manually recorded for now.
3. After recording every room's unit consumption, user is take to page that list all readings.
4. The user can access a room list with energy readings and track the consumption within time
5. Apps design should follow [this design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/13271423/Bodytrackit-An-iOs-app-Branding-UX-and-UI)
6. User can seamlessly select and view individual day readings.
7. App must be responsive, on both tablet and desktop versions, following given design guidelines.
8. During sign up, users must input month purchased units (i.e. 1800, 2100, 2400, 2700, 3000).
9. During signup, users must input percentage of target savings (i.e. 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%).
